# Arnautica
This project is about interfaces, builders and factories.
   ## Interfaces
   Interfaces define what methods a class must implement
   ## Inheritance
   If a class is inherited from another, it automatically implements the methods defined in the parent class. If the parent class is abstract, you can override the methods defined in the parent class.

# Creatures
